# AppSmith
C# MS-SQL Database table modeler.  

![SQLView](https://mmeents.github.io/files/AppSmithSqlTable.png)

App using Tree Control that Reads/Saves as a Dictionary via MessagePack to a file.    
tree is a model of a Server.  So far I have code parsing/generation to SQL Tables. 
can imagine doing more with functions views and procedures as well as c# entities API controllers and methods

first version models database tables and code needed when working with them.    
Started typing out and naming Api endpoints and controller methods. 

Project target Framework net48 showcases the following components 
 Visual Studio Standard Tree View control, splitter, and tab controls.
 package FCTB version 2.16.24  - For the syntax highlighting text editors.
 package MessagePack version 2.5.140 - For the high-performance object serialization  
 package PropertyGridEx version 1.0.0 - Property editor to modify the data. 

So sorry no build, if I built it for you, your os wouldn't trust it anyway so good reason to download Visual Studio Community edition and build and run it.

Cheers
